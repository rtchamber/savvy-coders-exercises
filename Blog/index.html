<h2>Welcome to my blog! It's 2017 and the world is still spinning, somehow.
Thanks for coming! </h2>

Bloop. This is a bloop and it is a header! This is how I will begin
dividing up the page.

<body>
<p> I exist, I am human. I live on a planet called "earth" that is mostly
covered in water. </p>
<div class ="section">
  <p>This is also a weird section because I'm not actually saying
  anything of any importance. Unfortunately for you. Apparently I never have
and more than likely never will, so turn back now unless you want to waste
a massive amount of time reading stuff here. Abandon all hope ye who enter here.
